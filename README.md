Eye Tracking software for student graffiti wall for school. 

So i imagine ironman puts a lot of time and effort into his first few projects. They require the hardest thinking first. 

So what problems does he solve?

His helmet software Eye tracking with Self learning AI. Then on the screen, creates a circle of the next predicted eye movement. This allows Spencer to get used to the speed and pace of another object. So why not add that app to a computer? It would be a phase one before the suit assembles.



and Jarvis, what is Jarvis that Self learning AI is not? 

More personable. or relatable?
Predictable?
Trust? 
Adaptability?
